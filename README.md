# Steam Library Analysis: Uncovering User Behaviour and Video Game Popularity
## Report Summary
In examining the Steam Game Dataset, our initial dataset comprised three tables: 'Games', 'Recommendations', and 'Users'. After an initial data cleaning step that removed customers lacking purchases, we explored the data seeking insights into Steam user behavior and video game popularity dynamics. Our analysis examined key metrics like playtime, reviews, pricing, operating systems, and seasonal game release trends. Through this exploratory data analysis, we discovered that Steam users own an average of 124 games but only engage deeply with a few, spending merely 1.3 hours per game on average. However, top games like “Lost Ark” and “Elden Ring” display much higher playtimes, indicating the presence of some wildly popular titles. We also found ratings strongly correlate with playtime, showing the importance of positive user experiences for engagement. Seasonally, October emerges as the top month for new releases, potentially driven by holiday purchases and awards buzz. Additionally, while Windows dominates among Steam users, Windows-exclusive games cost on average $5 less than cross-platform titles. Overall, by analyzing Steam data we gained significant insights into user behavior patterns, the dynamics behind video game popularity, and opportunities to optimize experiences on the platform. Key discoveries show Steam users’ tendency to have fragmented playtimes across a large library, highlight the outsized influence of hit games like “Lost Ark”, and suggest the impact of seasonal purchasing on releases. This analysis offers a data-backed examination of the Steam platform through metrics like pricing, ratings, recommendations and operating systems.
